# Religious Worker Visa Renewal

If you are currently residing in Japan with a YWAM Japan issued visa, you can start the process of renewing your Religious Worker visa from **3 months** prior to it expiring. We recommend starting the process of gathering the required documents prior to this. This page details this process. **Please follow this process carefully.**

## The Process

- Message your YWAM location's visa person the following: residence card number, length of desired visa extension (**1, 3, or 5 years**), and the **name and address of your sending church** (who will be providing letters as part of this application).
- Gather together all required documents (detailed below).
- You then go to your local immigration office and submit all of these documents.
- You will receive a postcard through the mail after between 2 weeks and 1 month when your application has been processed. Take this to the immigration office, along with the 4,000 yen revenue stamp, in order to pick up your new residence card.

## Required Documentation

Please find below a list of what you need in order to apply for your visa extension.

- Two original, signed letters on church stationary, **not copies**, from your sending church: **Letter of Dispatch** and **Letter of Release**. (Your YWAM location's visa person can provide more details of what these must include)
- **Japanese Tax (or Tax Exemption) Certificate** - issued by the city office where you resided as of the previous 1 January.
