This page acts as a description of the main communication tool used within YWAM Japan that we feel is important to realize the basic operation of an efficient community.

# Element

The backbone of YWAM Japan communication is the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) protocol--an open network for secure, decentralized communication. **Element** is the app we use to communicate on the Matrix protocol.
