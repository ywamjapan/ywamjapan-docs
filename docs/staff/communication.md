This page acts as a description of the main communication tool used within YWAM Japan that we feel is important to realize the basic operation of an efficient community.

#Element

The backbone of YWAM Japan communication is the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) protocol--an open network for secure, decentralized communication.

To connect with our community, you can connect with us [here](https://app.element.io/#/group/+ywamsendai:matrix.org).

###Element tutorial for YWAM Sendai community members

1. Log into Element or make a new user and go directly to the YWAM Sendai community.
1. Join the YWAM Sendai community +ywamsendai:matrix.org
1. On the community page, click the gear icon on top slightly right and enable **publish this community on your profile** (you will get a cool YWAM Sendai flair when posting in one of our rooms on Element from now on!)
1. Join whichever rooms you like, all YWAM Sendai rooms can be found via main room search as well.

###Short Element user manual and best practices
