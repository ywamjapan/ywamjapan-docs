This page details general fundraising goals we feel may be helpful for YWAMers in Japan to aim for, and gives some tips on budgeting.

## Financial Support

In YWAM, nobody gets paid by YWAM! Finances do not come through YWAM Japan before going to the missionary. Each member has full responsibility for raising their own financial support and to steward that money well. Of course, we do not truth in people alone for our support. We value total reliance on God and to have faith that God is who He says He is - Provider. We believe that God will fully provide for those He calls to the mission field.

As a mission field, Japan can be a particularly expensive place. Though we fully believe that God provides for us, and know that there are those that live day to day without knowing where their next donation will come from, we have seen people like this struggle here in Japan. This is disheartening. It is especially difficult when people start to get into debt because it is so expensive to live here! We don't believe its ever God's plan for people to struggle continuously and to get into debt.

Each YWAM location/ministry in Japan is encouraged to set a **Minimum Support Level** that must be reached before we can start the visa application process of a new staff.

If you are considering joining a location/ministry shorter term (1 to 2 years), savings can be considered as part of your support by dividing your savings by the number of months you'd like to serve here. Savings should also include moving-in and setup costs (see below). But please do not do this without prayer, as it is much better to raise the full amount in monthly support before your arrival.

Please discuss this with your receiving location/ministry.

## Moving-in and Setup Costs

Along with monthly financial support, you will also need an amount of money on top of that when starting life in Japan. Here is an example of some initial costs:

- Flight to Japan
- Initial fees for moving into an apartment (this can cost anywhere from an extra 2 to 4 months worth of rent)
- Furniture & appliances (and any devices such as a Japan-compatible mobile phone if you don't already have one)

These costs will vary depending on the cost of your rent and how much they require as a deposit. Some locations will have shared accommodation, meaning your set up costs would not be much. Again, please discuss this with your receiving location/ministry.

As a general guide, we recommend that you have *at least* two months worth of support in the bank when you arrive in Japan.

## Staff Fee

As each YWAMer is financially supported in order to live in Japan, YWAMers' needs are met. Though this is the case, your receiving YWAM location/ministry has expenses that are not met because they may not have their own regular income. In order to meet these needs, your location/ministry may ask that each staff member pay a monthly staff fee.

The following are ways in which this money may be used:

- At least Â¥1,000 goes to the YWAM Japan National Office
- Fund to purchase and maintain a building (for office, meetings, cafe, school lectures, public worship etc.)
- Emergency fund (disaster relief etc.)
- Ministry events
- Admin costs (printing, website, office supplies etc.)
- Purchasing shared assets (computer, projector, instruments, vehicle etc.)
- Community meeting supplies (coffee, snacks etc.)
- Fund to purchase and maintain a vehicle
- Hospitality (hosting guests, volunteers & teams)
- Donate to local churches and ministries
- Rent and utilities (if there is YWAM accommodation)

Please feel free to ask your receiving location/ministry specific questions regarding any staff fee. We want to be as transparent as possible in regards to community finances!

## Financial Records & Budgeting

Not everyone has experience with budgeting. Not only do we want to be good stewards of the money God is entrusting us with, but it is also practically helpful to budget and keep track of our finances.

We encourage all YWAMers in Japan to set monthly budgets and to record income and expenses. This will also be useful for filing taxes (see below).

## Tax & State Pension

### Tax
It is important that all YWAMers in Japan find out rules related to filing taxes both in their sending country, *as well as in Japan*.

For information on filing taxes in Japan, see [this page](../lifeinjapan/tax.md)

### State Pension

You will be enrolled into the state pension in Japan as is required of all residents. As monthly contributions can be fairly pricey, you will likely have the option of opting out of making contributions due to low income.

It may be worth looking into whether you would like to pay into a state pension in your sending country, either instead of or in addition to the Japanese pension.

We do recommend you pay into *at least one state pension* in either your home country or Japan and that you budget accordingly.

## Working in Japan

If your residence in Japan is permitted based on a Religious Activities Visa, there are rules about making money in Japan.

You are permitted to earn money if the work is directly related to your religious activities. For example, if a church pays you to teach English.

If you wanted to earn supplementary income while in Japan by other means, you must apply for a specific work permit. Though this would only be for work that is still *related* to your missionary work in some way *and* does not take away your time or focus from your missionary activities.

That's the legal side! Regardless, we do recommend that all YWAMers in Japan be fully supported financially, if possible. If you would like to apply for a work permit while in Japan, please discuss this with your receiving location/ministry.
