title: New Religious Worker Visa
---

As YWAM Japan is a registered Religious Corporation, we can assist foreign YWAMers who do not already have residency in Japan in receiving a Religious Worker visa. Please note that we can only offer this to those who will be, or are already, **connected with an existing YWAM location or ministry that is part of YWAM Japan's Religious Corporation**.

If you do not yet have residency permission to live in Japan, part of your [process to join as YWAM Japan staff](join.md) is to receive a visa from Japanese Immigration. This page details this process. **Please follow this process carefully.**

If you have any questions about anything on this page, and please stay in touch with your receiving location/ministry throughout the process so they know how you are doing.

We look forward to your arrival and serving alongside you in reaching the Japanese!

## The Process

Each location/ministry in YWAM Japan may have a different process which they will communicate with you. The following is a general process to help you.

- Inform your receiving location/ministry that you have reached at least the [Minimum Support Level](finances.md) of financial support and would like to begin this process.
- You will work with your receiving location/ministry in filling out the Certificate of Eligibility (CoE) Application form.
- You send your receiving location/ministry **all required documents** via **both** email and physical mail (detailed below).
- Your receiving location/ministry will then apply for a CoE from Japanese Immigration once your documents have been received (can take 6 to 12 weeks).
- The **CoE** will be sent to you once your receiving location/ministry receive it.
- Your receiving location/ministry will email you a **Certificate for Completion of Registration to the ERFS system** and **Declaration form** (introduced due to the COVID pandemic).
- You then **go to your local Japanese Embassy or Consulate** and submit a **Visa Application** form, **CoE**, **Certificate for Completion of Registration to the ERFS system**, **Declaration form**, and your **passport** in order to apply for your visa.
- Usually within a few days, you can return to the Embassy or Consulate to pick up your passport with your visa! This likely must be done in person, but sometimes they give you the option to receive it via mail. You can check this with them.
- You can now book your flight to Japan! (**Note: please donâ€™t purchase your airline ticket until your visa is issued in case of unexpected delays**).
- You must enter Japan within 3 months of receiving your visa.

## Required Documentation

Please find below a list of what is needed from you in order to begin the process of applying for your Certificate of Eligibility.

- Copy of your passport **photo page** (the copy must be clear and all information legible)
- A 4cm x 3cm portrait photograph (should be clear, with a plain background, and recently taken. Applicant in photo should be facing forward, without sunglasses, hats, etc.)
- Two original, signed letters on church stationary, **not copies**, from your sending church: **Letter of Dispatch** and **Letter of Release**. (Your receiving location/ministry can provide more details of what these must include)

**Note:** If any of these documents are in another language other than English or Japanese, please also provide English or Japanese translations.

Please send all printed documents, as well as scanned copies, to the mailing and email addresses given to you by your receiving location/ministry.
