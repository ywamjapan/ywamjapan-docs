If you feel you may be called to reach and love the Japanese in Japan, then we would love to have you consider joining us!

## Choosing a Ministry Location

First, you will need to choose a location! You can find a list of YWAM locations on our [website](https://www.ywamjapan.org/). Please prayfully explore the different locations and ministries and get in touch with them about their application process.

You can find a general outline of what an onboarding process can look like [here](onboarding.md).
