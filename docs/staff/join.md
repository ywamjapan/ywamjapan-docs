# Join the Team!

If you feel you may be called to reach and love the Japanese in Japan, then we would love to have you consider joining our team!

As a staff at YWAM Sendai, you will become an integral part of a pioneering missional community where your gifting and personality will shape our culture and influence how we reach the Japanese.

Above all, you should come ready to pursue God in prayer and worship and be committed to developing a naturally supernatural lifestyle. You should also be flexible as this is a pioneering YWAM community, not just a gathering of individual missionaries.
