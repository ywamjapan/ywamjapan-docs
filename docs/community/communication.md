This page describes how YWAMers in Japan communicate with each other.

## Chat

The backbone of YWAM Japan communication is the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) protocol--an open network for secure, decentralized communication. **Element** is the app we use to communicate on the Matrix protocol.

We have installed a bridge from our main public Open Chat room on Matrix to Telegram.

To connect with our community, you can use one of the following apps:

- [Element](https://matrix.to/#/#ywamjapan-openchat:matrix.org)
- [Telegram](https://t.me/+PcpvBBR5FZUyOTk1) (Main public room only)

If you are (or are joining as) a staff member, please use Element.

### Quick Sign-up Tutorial for Element

1. After you're logged in, join our public [Open Chat room](https://matrix.to/#/#ywamjapan-openchat:matrix.org) and say hello!
