## What & Why?

**What is Member Care?** Member Care or Whole Person Care is a ministry that supports the spiritual, physical, emotional and mental well-being of field workers. Member Care aims to help missionaries cultivate a lifestyle with Christ that is healthy, resilient and effective while on the field. We do this by bringing awareness of the challenges and needs of missionaries from pre-field, to on-field and all the way to re-entry to their home country. YWAM approaches member care support for the whole person through the levels of the 7 S’s of Care: Savior Care, Self Care, Staff Care, Shepherd Care, Structure Care, Sender-Support Care and Specialist Care. Visit YWAM International Member Care site for a detailed explanation of the 7 levels of care.

**Why is Member Care important?** Healthy leaders and missionaries make healthy teams that make lasting impact for the Kingdom of God. Member care helps to evaluate and address the challenges and reasons why missionaries leave the field prematurely and offer support by sharing tools, teachings, resources and care practices to ensure the sustainability and longevity of our workers so they can joyfully fulfill their missions call to the nations.  Visit YWAM International Member Care site for more information on the importance of member care for missions.
