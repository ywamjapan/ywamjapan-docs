title: Filing Japanese Taxes
---

Taxes are something nobody really enjoys thinking about, yet we all need to do it. It is complicated, even when you understand the language! But you are likely having to face taxes in Japanese with a language barrier on top!

This document will hopefully help bring clarity to filing taxes in Japan.

**Note:** the information on this page, though hopefully helpful, is not financial advice and does not replace a tax accountant. You are responsible for correctly filing your own taxes :)

## Introduction

### Key Dates

In Japan, the tax year runs from **1 January to 31 December** each year.

You should file your tax return(s) between **16 February and 15 March** following the end of the tax year.

### Two Main Tax Returns

There are two main taxes to be filed in Japan that you should be aware of:

1. *Shotokuzei* (income tax) - paid to the national government
2. *Jūminzei* (resident tax) - paid to the local government (prefecture/city)

You should submit either one of these tax returns each year. If you submit an income tax return (*kakutei shinkoku*), you *do not* need to file a resident tax return (*jūminzei no shinkoku*). On the other hand, if you *do not* file an income tax return, you *will* need to file a resident tax return.

You can also find basic information on income tax and resident tax on the [GaijinPot blog](https://blog.gaijinpot.com/a-quick-guide-taxes-japan/).

## Income Tax

So first you need to find out if you should file an income tax return. This will depend on your residential status, as well as your income amount.

### Residential Categories

If you are a *Japanese citizen* or have been *living in Japan for more than five years in the past ten years*, you are categorised as a **resident other than non-permanent resident**. This means that **all of your income (domestic and overseas) is subject to taxation**.

If you are *not a Japanese citizen* and have been *living in Japan for between one and five years in the past ten years*, you are regarded as a **non-permanent resident**. This means that only the following are taxable:

- Income originating in Japan
- Income originating overseas that is actually sent to Japan

#### For Non-Permanent Residents

If you receive a donation from an overseas individual or group directly to your *Japanese* bank account, you should categorise it appropriately and **report the income** in your tax return.

If, however, a donation is sent from a donor's overseas account to your *overseas* bank account, things become unclear. Overseas income is not subject to taxation unless sent to Japan. If you use a bank card connected to your overseas bank account while in Japan, you *are* technically drawing from a pool that contains income that should be subject to taxation when sent to Japan. But there is no way for either you nor the National Tax Agency to know whether the money sent to Japan was income made during the tax year in question. Thus, it is our understanding that you do not need to report your regular bank card use as overseas income sent to Japan.

**Note:** If you transfer more than ¥1,000,000 in one go, the Tax Agency will be notified and you will be asked whether you have sources of income overseas. (You should of course answer their questions honestly!)

#### Special note for US Citizens

Most countries, including Japan, have a *residence-based* taxation system. This means that when most foreign citizens move to Japan, they will be required to pay taxes to Japan and *not* to their country of citizenship.

This is not the case, however, for US citizens, as the US has a *citizenship-based* taxation system. This means that *US citizens are required to file their taxes to the IRS even while living abroad*. There are agreements, however, between Japan and the US to prevent double taxation, so you should only have to pay to one country. Please talk to your US tax return preparer for the best strategy to handle your situation.

One way to avoid double taxation is by deducting the amount you have paid to a foreign income tax from your Japanese income tax amount. For more information on this, see the [National Tax Agency's website](https://www.nta.go.jp/english/taxes/individual/12007.htm).

Here are a few other resources from the website, "*Taxes For Expats*": [Simple Tax Guide for Americans in Japan](https://www.taxesforexpats.com/country_guides/japan/us-tax-preparation-in-japan.html), [US Missionary Tax Guide](https://www.taxesforexpats.com/guides/missionary-guide.html).

### Income

Now that you know your tax residency, the amount of taxable income will determine whether or not you file income taxes.

If your taxable income during the tax year was *greater than the standard deduction amount of ¥480,000*, you are required to pay income tax and thus are required to **file an income tax return**.

#### What is taxable income?

As YWAMers, we receive our earnings in an unusual way. Rather than being paid by YWAM (where we actually work), we receive support from religious organizations (like our sending churches), via NPOs (like EquipNet or Stewardship), or even directly from individuals. Some of our donors may be domestic, but for most of us they are international.

If we received our income as a salary from YWAM, filing our taxes would be simpler. Since this is not the case, however, we have to categorise our income carefully. You can use the chart below to help categorise the different types of financial support you receive.

![How should I categorise my income?](./assets/taxableincome.png)

Here is some more detailed information to help you categorize your income by type:

**Support From Groups**

1. **Employment income (*kyūyo shotoku*)** — Regular support from or via a group (e.g. a church, NPO)
2. **Occasional income (*ichiji shotoku*)** — From or via a group, if one of the following applies:
- Not missionary support but explicitly a gift
- Not received regularly

**Support From Individuals or Groups**

1. **Miscellaneous income, operations (*zatsu shotoku*, *gyōmu*)** — Payments received in exchange for specific ministry work such as giving a lecture, interpreting, leading worship, or babysitting
2. **Miscellaneous income, other (*zatsu shotoku*, *sonota*)** — General support with no designated use

**Support From Individuals (Both types below are categorized in the same way.)**

1. **Gift (*zōyo*)** — Support received to fund certain ministry work
2. **Gift (*zōyo*)** — Not missionary support but explicitly a gift

For information on categorising different types of income not mentioned here, see the National Tax Agency’s guide [here](https://www.nta.go.jp/english/taxes/individual/pdf/incometax_2021/01.pdf#page=10). (This guide is from 2021, so some information may be outdated.)

#### Gift Tax

There is a gift tax (*zōyo zei*), but most gifts received by those in our community would be exempted from taxation, as the chart below shows.

![What gifts are exempted from taxation?](./assets/gifttax.png)

In addition, even if the gift is potentially subject to taxation according to the chart above, the following types of gifts are also exempted from taxation:

1. **Gifts received from immediate family** (spouses, parents and grandparents, children and grandchildren, or siblings) to **help with living expenses** (including medical treatment expenses, child-raising expenses) or **education expenses** (including tuition, educational materials and stationery costs)
- If a gift is received as a large lump sum (e.g. 10 years worth of education expenses), it *will* be subject to taxation. In order for gifts to qualify for a tax exemption, they must be within reasonable amounts and be received when actually needed.
2. **Gifts given by individuals to people working for the public good** (in the fields of religion, charity, education, etc.) that are certain to be **used in order to fund such work**

Finally, a standard deduction of ¥1,100,000 is applied to gifts that don’t fall into either of the above two categories. This means that if the gifts that don’t fall into the above two categories add up to less than ¥1,100,000, you do not need to file a gift tax return.

On the other hand, if you received more than ¥1,100,000 in gifts that don't fall into either of the above two categories, you will need to file a gift tax return.

For more information on the gift tax, see [here](https://www.nta.go.jp/english/taxes/others/02/15002.htm).

Remember, payments received from groups are **always** categorised as income, rather than as gifts.

### Filing Income Tax

You can file income tax either:

- Online using a MyNumber card (if you have an NFC-enabled smartphone - simplest method)
- Online by setting up an ID and password
- Through the mail
- In person at your local tax office (tends to be time-consuming and crowded)

You can find links to the online system, as well as how to apply via the mail, [here](https://www.keisan.nta.go.jp/kyoutu/ky/sm/top#bsctrl).

As everything will be in Japanese, you may find it helpful to ask a Japanese-speaking friend for help (or use Google Translate!).

For more detailed information on income tax, see the National Tax Agency’s guide [here](https://www.nta.go.jp/english/taxes/individual/pdf/incometax_2021/01.pdf). (This guide is from the 2021, so some information may be outdated.)

#### Earnings - Expenses = Income

When filling out the final income tax return, there will be sections for inputting your total earnings (*shūnyū*; 収入), as well as for inputting your income (*shotoku*; 所得) after expenses (*keihi*; 経費) have been subtracted.

The tax amount is calculated based on your income and not your total earnings. Certain business and ministry expenses [may qualify as expenses](https://www.nta.go.jp/english/taxes/individual/12015.htm). It's not 100% clear what expenses would be considered legitimate expenses, so it might be best to separate out your expenses and ask about them at the tax office.

If you are filling out your tax form at the tax office, follow whatever advice you receive.

#### Documents to prepare

Assuming you are filing using the e-Tax online system:

1. User identification number (If you have previously filed your income tax return
2. Copy of your income tax return forms from last year (If you filed your income tax return last year)
3. ID documents — Either a MyNumber card, or at least two other forms of ID (residence card, driving licence, copy of *jūminhyō*, health insurance card etc.)
5. Bank details

## Resident Tax

If you were resident in Japan for a full tax year, and you do not need to file an income tax return, you should **file a resident tax return**.

Even those with a taxable income of ¥0 *should file a resident tax return*. This is because filing one of the tax returns lets the government know your income level, allowing them to:

- set the appropriate health insurance fee
- issue proof of tax payment (necessary for visa renewals), etc.

You should file your resident tax return to the city/prefecture where you were living as of 1 January, immediately following the end of the previous tax year.

### Filing Resident Tax

You should file your resident tax return to the city where you were living as of 1 January immediately after the tax year in question. Each prefecture and city in Japan will have their own procedure for filing resident tax. Please visit their website, or the office in person, for more information.

In general, if you had no taxable income during the tax year:
- Fill out the address (住所), name (氏名), MyNumber (個人番号（マイナンバー）), etc.
- *If you have any dependents* — Fill out your dependents' name (氏名), MyNumber (個人番号（マイナンバー）), etc. in the rows for "Spouse Deduction" (配偶者控除), "Dependent Deduction" (扶養控除), and "Dependent Family Members Under 16 Years Old" (16歳未満の扶養親族).
- Check the appropriate box in "Section 18, For Those Without an Income "(18収入がなかった方の記入欄). If selecting "Other," specify.

#### Documents to prepare

1. Resident tax return form
2. Documents to verify identity (e.g. MyNumber card, *jūminhyō no utsushi*, driver's licence, passport, health insurance card) - If submitting MyNumber card, you do not need any other document to verify your identity.
3. Documentation of income (e.g. Withholding certificate/*gensen chōshūhyō*, statement of pay)
4. Documentation to apply for any deductions
