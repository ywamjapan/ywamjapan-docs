title: Filing Japanese Taxes
---

Taxes are something nobody really enjoys thinking about. It is important, and we all need to do it. But it is so complicated, even if you understand the language! But you are likely having to face taxes in Japanese with a language barrier on top!

This document will hopefully help bring clarity to filing taxes in Japan.

**Note:** this wonderful research was put together by our very own Aogu! He is a gifted man, but is not a financial advisor or tax accountant. We hope this content helps you! But you are responsible for correctly filing your own taxes :)

## 1. Who is required to file tax?

There are two kinds of taxes to be filed in Japan:

1. *Shotokuzei* (income tax) - paid to the national government
2. *Jūminzei* (resident tax) - paid to local governments (prefecture and city)

There is a tax return form for both kinds of tax, but if you submit an income tax return (*kakutei shinkoku*), you *do not* need to file a resident tax return (*jūminzei no shinkoku*). On the other hand, if you *do not* file an income tax return, you *will* need to file a resident tax return.

### Income Tax Return or Resident Tax Return?

If you had an address in Japan at any time during the tax year in question (1 January to 31 December), you are considered a resident in the country and are, in principle, [required to file an income tax return](https://www.nta.go.jp/english/taxes/individual/12011.htm).

However, if your income during the tax year was **less than the standard deduction amount of ¥480,000**, you would not be required to pay any income tax and thus are *not required to file an income tax return*. You must, however, *file a resident tax return* at your local city office.

If your income during the tax year was **less than ¥450,000**, you would not in principle have to pay any resident tax, either. However, even those with a taxable income of ¥0 *should file a resident tax return*. This is because filing one of the tax returns lets the government know your income level, allowing them to:

- set the appropriate health insurance fee
- issue proof of tax payment (necessary for visa renewals), etc.

## 2. How should I categorise my income?

As YWAMers, we receive our earnings in an unusual way. Rather than being paid by YWAM (where we actually work), we receive support from religious organizations (like our sending churches), via NPOs (like EquipNet or Stewardship), or even directly from individuals. Some of our donors may be domestic, but for most of us they are international.

If we received our income as a salary from YWAM, filing our taxes would be simpler. Since this is not the case, however, we have to categorise our income carefully. You can use the chart below to help categorise the different types of financial support you receive.

Here is some more detailed information to help you categorize your income by type:

### Support From Groups

1. **Employment income (*kyūyo shotoku*)** — Regular support from or via a group (e.g. a church, NPO)
2. **Occasional income (*ichiji shotoku*)** — From or via a group, if one of the following applies:
- Not missionary support but explicitly a gift
- Not received regularly

### Support From Individuals or Groups

1. **Miscellaneous income, operations (*zatsu shotoku*, *gyōmu*)** — Payments received in exchange for specific ministry work such as giving a lecture, interpreting, leading worship, or babysitting
2. **Miscellaneous income, other (*zatsu shotoku*, *sonota*)** — General support with no designated use

### Support From Individuals (Both types below are categorized in the same way.)

1. **Gift (*zōyo*)** — Support received to fund certain ministry work
2. **Gift (*zōyo*)** — Not missionary support but explicitly a gift

### More info

For information on categorising different types of income not mentioned here, see the National Tax Agency’s guide [here](https://www.nta.go.jp/english/taxes/individual/pdf/incometax_2021/01.pdf#page=10). (This guide is from 2021, so some information may be outdated.)

## 3. What is this about a gift tax?

There is a gift tax (*zōyo zei*), but most gifts received by those in our community would be exempted from taxation, as the chart below shows.

![What gifts are exempted from taxation?](./assets/gifttax.png)

In addition, even if the gift is potentially subject to taxation according to the chart above, the following types of gifts are also exempted from taxation:

1. **Gifts received from immediate family** (spouses, parents and grandparents, children and grandchildren, or siblings) to **help with living expenses** (including medical treatment expenses, child-raising expenses) or **education expenses** (including tuition, educational materials and stationery costs)
- If a gift is received as a large lump sum (e.g. 10 years worth of education expenses), it *will* be subject to taxation. In order for gifts to qualify for a tax exemption, they must be within reasonable amounts and be received when actually needed.
2. **Gifts given by individuals to people working for the public good** (in the fields of religion, charity, education, etc.) that are certain to be **used in order to fund such work**

Finally, a standard deduction of ¥1,100,000 is applied to gifts that don’t fall into either of the above two categories. This means that if the gifts that don’t fall into the above two categories add up to less than ¥1,100,000, you do not need to file a gift tax return.

On the other hand, if you received more than ¥1,100,000 in gifts that don't fall into either of the above two categories, you will need to file a gift tax return.

### More Info

- For more information on the gift tax, see [here](https://www.nta.go.jp/english/taxes/others/02/15002.htm).
- Remember, payments received from groups are **always** categorised as income, rather than as gifts.
