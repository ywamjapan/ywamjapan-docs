title: Legal Entity

YWAM Japan has a legal entity here in Japan, called a Religious Corporation (宗教法人), under the name of 世界青年宣教会 (Sekai Seinen Senkyokai).

Most YWAM ministries within Japan are members of this Religious Corporation. Although it is not a requirement for YWAM ministries to become members, it is something we highly recommend.

### Benefits

The benefits of YWAM ministries being part of the legal entity include:

- Having legal protection
- Being able to open bank accounts
- Being able to rent or purchase property or other assets
- Being able to issue and renew Religious Worker visas

### Requirements

The requirements of being a member of the legal entity include:

- Keeping record of finances and submitting those records to the YWAM Japan National Office once a year
- Attending General Meetings in order to vote on budgets and legal policy changes etc. (at least once or twice per year, usually online)

### Becoming a member

Whether you are an existing YWAM ministry here in Japan, or if you would like to pioneer here, we encourage you to think about joining YWAM Japan's legal entity!

In order for your ministry to join the legal entity, we usually ask that an existing membership ministry recommend you to join. This is so that we can prioritise relationship over merely a legal process.

So we encourage you to reach out to an existing ministry and build relationship with them. They can then vouch for your ministry, and we can begin the process of integrating you into the legal entity officially.

Please get in touch with us for more information, or to ask any questions.
