YWAM Japan has a legal entity here in Japan, called a Religious Corporation (宗教法人), under the name of 世界青年宣教会 (Sekai Seinen Senkyokai).

Most YWAM ministries within Japan are members of this Religious Corporation. Although it is not a requirement for YWAM ministries to become members, it is something we highly recommend.

## Benefits

The benefits of YWAM ministries being part of the legal entity include:

- Having legal protection
- Being able to open bank accounts
- Being able to rent or purchase property or other assets
- Being able to issue and renew Religious Activities Visas

## Requirements

The requirements of being a member of the legal entity include:

- Keeping record of finances and submitting those records to the YWAM Japan National Office once a year
- Attending General Meetings in order to vote on budgets and other legal matters (around twice per year, usually online)

## Becoming a member

Whether you are an existing YWAM ministry here in Japan, or if you would like to pioneer here, we encourage you to think about joining YWAM Japan's legal entity.

In order for your ministry to join the legal entity, we have the following process:

- find the nearest YWAM ministry to where you are based/would like to pioneer (*who is a member of the legal entity*) and build relationship with them
- if you are pioneering a team that is sent from another YWAM location, you may be asked to set up a meeting between your sending location and the location in Japan
- ask them if they can be your guarantor (someone who can vouch for your character and ministry, and can keep you accountable moving forward)
- if this is your *first time coming to Japan*, you may be asked to join their team (or another) for a period in order to help orient you to the culture and YWAM Japan (recommended)
- they will set up a meeting for you to speak with YWAM Japan's Legal Team in order to discuss details on integrating your ministry into the legal entity officially

We have created this process in order to prioritise relationship over merely a legal process, and to ensure all members of the legal entity fully understand its requirements and expectations.

Please get in touch with us for more information, or to ask any questions.
