title: Guaranteeing YWAM Teams
---

A YWAM team may ask existing YWAM ministries to be their guarantor when applying to join YWAM Japan's legal entity. This could be:

- a team sent out from this location
- a team coming from outside Japan
- a team already in Japan (but not within the legal entity)

This page details the expectations on a ministry acting as a guarantor for a team.


## Process

In order for the team's ministry to join the legal entity, we have the following process:

- they reach out to you in order to build relationship
- if they are pioneering a team that is sent from another YWAM location outside Japan, ask them to set up a meeting between their sending location and your location
- they will ask if your location will be their guarantor in this process
- if this is their *first time coming to Japan*, you may feel it would be beneficial for them to join your team (or another location within Japan) for a period in order to help orient them to the culture and YWAM Japan (recommended)
- if you are happy to move forward, set up a meeting with YWAM Japan's Legal Team in order to discuss details on integrating their ministry into the legal entity officially

## Expectations

Here are some expectations we have on ministries who guarantee teams who join the legal entity:

- take responsibility for any issues the team makes regarding legal matters
- train the team to correctly keep financial records and how to send records to the National Office
- train the team on how to apply for and renew Religious Worker visas
- keep the team accountable moving forward, both with legal responsibilities and pastorally
