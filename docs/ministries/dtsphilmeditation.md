Meditate on Philippians 4:4â€“13, reflecting back over the last 5/6 months.

- Write down any insights that you have learned about yourself.

- What do you feel God has been focusing on for you personally?

- What have you learned about missions?

- Are there any steps that you feel that God is asking you to take in order to put into practice what
you have learned?

- Are there any obstacles in doing the above? (Fears, uncertainties, lack of plan, etc.)

- Take a sheet of paper and write yourself a letter based upon your findings from this reflection time. Place the letter in an envelope, seal it, address it to your permanent address, and hand it in to the school leader.
