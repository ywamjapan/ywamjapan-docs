title: UofN Course Registration
---

In order for a UofN course to be properly registered, you need to follow a specific process on the [UofN WebApp](http://app.uofn.edu/).

You can find a PDF with detailed instructions on how to do this [here](../assets/English_-_UofN_WebApp_Instructions_Jan_2019.pdf).

We also have screenshots of the process to create a [course instance](../assets/Creating_a_CI.pdf) and a [course registration](../assets/Creating_a_CR.pdf).
