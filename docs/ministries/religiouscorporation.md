YWAM Japan has a legal entity here in Japan, called a Religious Corporation (宗教法人), under the name of 世界青年宣教会 (Sekai Seinen Senkyokai).

Most YWAM ministries within Japan are members of this Religious Corporation. Although it is not a requirement for YWAM ministries to become members, it is something we highly recommend.

## Benefits

The benefits of YWAM ministries and locations being part of the Religious Corporation include:

- Having legal protection
- Being able to open bank accounts in YWAM Japan’s name
- Being able to rent or purchase property or other assets in YWAM Japan’s name
- Being tax exempt when purchasing land or property in YWAM Japan’s name
- Being able to issue and renew Religious Activities Visas in YWAM Japan’s name
- Having a voice in how YWAM Japan’s Religious Corporation makes policy changes
- Being connected with other YWAMers in Japan in a deeper way

## Requirements

The requirements of being a member of the Religious Corporation include:

- Adhering to all of the rules and requirements of the Religious Corporation (this can be shared with you upon request)
- Working with the YWAM Japan Legal Team and National Office when it comes to matters related to the Religious Corporation
- Keeping correct record of finances using specific accounting software and submitting those records to the YWAM Japan National Office once a year
- Keeping receipts for at least 10 years
- Sending at least 1,000 yen staff fee per OpLoc/Ministry staff to the YWAM Japan National Office, as well as 5% of all ministry income
- Applying for Certificate of Eligibilities for new staff, working with the YWAM Japan National Office and Japanese Immigration
- Attending General Meetings in order to vote on budgets and other legal matters (around twice per year, usually online)
- Updating the YWAM Japan National Office on any staff changes (incoming staff, outgoing staff, visa renewals, address changes etc.)

## Joining

Whether you are an existing YWAM ministry here in Japan, or if you would like to pioneer here, we encourage you to think about joining YWAM Japan's Religious Corporation.

In order for your ministry to join the Religious Corporation, we have the following process:

### 1 Establish Relationship with an Overseeing YWAM Japan Ministry/OpLoc

Find a YWAM Japan (Religious Corporation member) location (preferably closest to where you would like to pioneer), share your vision with them, and start building relationship with them. Ask them about overseeing your team in Japan (helping you build relationship with YWAM Japan, keeping you accountable, and assisting you with legal matters).

*If you are being sent from a YWAM base overseas*, you may be asked to set up a meeting between your sending base and the overseeing OpLoc in Japan.

*If this is your first time coming to Japan*, you may be recommended to join their team (or another) for a period in order to help orient you to the culture and YWAM Japan. You can discuss this with them.

### 2 Religious Corporation Integration

Your overseeing location will set up a meeting for you to speak with YWAM Japan's Legal Team in order to discuss details on integrating your ministry into the Religious Corporation officially.


We have created this process in order to prioritise relationship over merely a legal process, and to ensure all members of the legal entity fully understand its requirements and expectations.

Please get in touch with us for more information, or to ask any questions.
